# OrderInfoSystem

## Overview
OrderInfoSystem is a Python-based console application designed to manage online order records for an electronics store. Built as part of a university assessment, the application demonstrates the use of procedural programming principles in Python. It utilizes parallel arrays to store order information and allows users to load, view, add, delete, and save data to a CSV file. This application provides a simple and effective way to manage small-scale order data without using databases. It supports learning goals related to file I/O, arrays, and procedural logic in Python.

## Features
- **CSV Integration**: Load and save order records from and to a .csv file.
- **Formatted Display**: Outputs neatly aligned data with headers and justification (right for numbers, left for text).
- **Record Management**:
- Add new orders with automated ID assignment
- Delete existing records
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Simple, user-friendly text-based menu for all operations.

## Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **IDE**: PyCharm / VS Code / Any text editor
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Data Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python is installed and available in your PATH
3. Make sure you have a CSV file ready, or edit the TrendsElectronics_OrderDetails.csv with sample data if needed
4. Run the script: python_orderinfo.py

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can perform the following operations:
Select menu options from the terminal:
- **Load records**: Loads data from the CSV into memory
- **Display**: Shows the formatted table of current records
- **Add record**: Prompts user to add a new order
- **Delete record**: Deletes an order by ID
- **Save record**: Writes current state back to CSV
- **Exit**: Ends the program

## Results
This project provides hands-on experience with Python file handling, procedural design, and user-driven interaction. It successfully replicates a basic information system model suitable for small-scale order processing.
